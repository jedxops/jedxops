- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeff
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, programming, chess, video games, technology, photos, philosophy...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows Powershell, DPC++, Advanced C++, and I am practicing my algorithms.
      Also sharpening my chess skills ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects of the future. I hope to leave society having had
      a large, positive impact on it. Growing, creative projects that are inspired on these principles
      are to my liking and of my utmost interest :)
